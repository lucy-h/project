Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document not found for class User with attributes {:email=>"lh2574"}.
Summary:
  When calling User.find_by with a hash of attributes, all attributes provided must match a document in the database or this error will be raised.
Resolution:
  Search for attributes that are in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document not found for class User with attributes {:email=>"w"}.
Summary:
  When calling User.find_by with a hash of attributes, all attributes provided must match a document in the database or this error will be raised.
Resolution:
  Search for attributes that are in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class User with id(s) 5302cd9c64796e0abc010000.
Summary:
  When calling User.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): 5302cd9c64796e0abc010000 ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: 5302cd9c64796e0abc010000.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Resolution:
  Search for attributes that are in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class User with id(s) 5302d09764796e0abc020000.
Summary:
  When calling User.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): 5302d09764796e0abc020000 ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: 5302d09764796e0abc020000.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document not found for class User with attributes {:email=>"lucyhe"}.
Summary:
  When calling User.find_by with a hash of attributes, all attributes provided must match a document in the database or this error will be raised.
Resolution:
  Search for attributes that are in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document not found for class User with attributes {:email=>"lucyhe"}.
Summary:
  When calling User.find_by with a hash of attributes, all attributes provided must match a document in the database or this error will be raised.
Resolution:
  Search for attributes that are in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error.):

Problem:
  Document not found for class User with attributes {:email=>"ldh"}.
Summary:
  When calling User.find_by with a hash of attributes, all attributes provided must match a document in the database or this error will be raised.
Resolution:
  Search for attributes that are in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class User with id(s) 5302d85b64796e0abc0f0000.
Summary:
  When calling User.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): 5302d85b64796e0abc0f0000 ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: 5302d85b64796e0abc0f0000.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document not found for class User with attributes {:email=>"dh"}.
Summary:
  When calling User.find_by with a hash of attributes, all attributes provided must match a document in the database or this error will be raised.
Resolution:
  Search for attributes that are in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error.):
